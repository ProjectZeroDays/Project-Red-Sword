# Project Red Sword: Cybersecurity Framework

Project Red Sword is an advanced cybersecurity framework designed to address and mitigate modern cyber threats. It integrates a wide variety of security tools, including advanced attack strategies, threat intelligence sources, and AI-driven techniques for proactive defense and post-exploitation. This repository aims to provide cutting-edge techniques, automation, and integrations for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity tasks.

## Project Overview

The Red Sword framework combines powerful cybersecurity tools and techniques into a single integrated platform. Some of the features include:
- AI-driven attack simulations and threat detection.
- A wide range of post-exploitation modules.
- Real-time attack and exploit automation.
- AI-powered fuzzing, exploit generation, and vulnerability scanning.
- Integration with major intelligence and FOIA sources.
- Full integration with tools like Sn1per, Empire, and custom modules for advanced penetration testing.

## Key Capabilities and Objectives of NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO)

The NSA's Tailored Access Operations (TAO) is a specialized cyber warfare intelligence-gathering unit within the National Security Agency (NSA). TAO is responsible for conducting highly sophisticated network penetrations and digital espionage operations against foreign targets of interest. Their primary mission is to gain access to sensitive information, disrupt enemy networks, and maintain a persistent presence within targeted systems.

TAO employs a wide range of advanced techniques, including custom-developed exploits, zero-day vulnerabilities, and sophisticated malware, to achieve their objectives. They often target high-value individuals, government agencies, and critical infrastructure networks.

### Detailed Information on TAO's Capabilities and Operations

For a detailed description of TAO's capabilities and operations, please refer to the `prompt` file in this repository.

## Setup

This framework requires Python 3.8+ and the following dependencies. It can be deployed easily in Hugging Face Spaces or similar environments.

### Install Requirements

You can install the necessary requirements using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Environment Variables

Some modules may require environment-specific credentials. You can set them up by creating a `.env` file or exporting them directly to your environment.

Example:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your-huggingface-api-key
```

### Deploying on Hugging Face Spaces

This project is designed to be deployed within Hugging Face Spaces, providing a seamless platform for model integration and AI-powered attack simulations.

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/your-username/project-red-sword
   cd project-red-sword
   ```

2. **Run the Space:**

   After cloning, you can launch the project directly using the Hugging Face Space interface.

### Features and Modules

The framework includes a wide array of functionalities:

1. **AI-Driven Attack and Defense**: Integrates with OpenAI and custom models for AI-powered cybersecurity operations.
2. **Real-Time Threat Detection and Evasion**: Implements automated detection and evasion strategies.
3. **Post-Exploitation Modules**: Includes advanced tools like keylogging, data exfiltration, and system persistence.
4. **Web Scraping and Reconnaissance**: Collects intelligence from public repositories and sources like FOIA.
5. **Penetration Testing Modules**: Integrates with Sn1per, Metasploit, and other tools for comprehensive testing.

### Key Modules:

- **AI Model Integrations**: For attack prediction and threat intelligence.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Keylogging, privilege escalation, system persistence.
- **Exploit Discovery**: Zero-day and zero-click exploit generation.
- **Custom Tools**: Including a custom script generator for Hak5 devices and other third-party platforms.
  
### Example Usage

```python
# Example of using a custom exploit generation module
from red_sword.modules.exploits import exploit_generator

# Generate a custom exploit for a vulnerability
exploit_code = exploit_generator(target='target_system')
print(exploit_code)
```

### Testing

The framework includes various tests, both unit and integration, to ensure everything works smoothly.

To run tests, you can use:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all available tests in the `tests` directory and check for any issues.
