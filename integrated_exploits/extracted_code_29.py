Continuing from where we left off, we'll enhance the Project Zero framework by integrating additional features such as an admin dashboard for user management, a blog maintenance system, advanced AI capabilities, and enhancements for the ticketing and notification systems. Here’s how we can proceed:
14. Admin Dashboard for User Management

We’ll create an admin dashboard to manage users, view ticket statuses, and access reports.

admin_dashboard.py
This file will serve as the admin interface, displaying users and their tickets.

@app.route('/admin/dashboard', methods=['GET'])
@login_required
def admin_dashboard():
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Access denied."}), 403

    users = User.query.all()
    tickets = Ticket.query.all()
    return render_template('admin_dashboard.html', users=users, tickets=tickets)

admin_dashboard.html
A simple HTML layout for the admin dashboard.

            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Status</th>
        </tr>
        {% for user in users %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ user.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ user.username }}</td>
            <td>{{ user.email }}</td>
            <td>{{ 'Active' if user.is_active else 'Inactive' }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>

    <h2>Tickets</h2>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Status</th>
            <th>User</th>
        </tr>
        {% for ticket in tickets %}
        <tr>
            <td>{{ ticket.id }}</td>
            <td>{{ ticket.title }}</td>
            <td>{{ ticket.status }}</td>
            <td>{{ ticket.user.username }}</td>
        </tr>
        {% endfor %}
    </table>
</body>
</html>

15. Blog System Maintenance by Gemini

We will integrate a blog system where the AI can post updates on the latest threats and compliance regulations.

blog_management.py

@app.route('/blog', methods=['GET'])
def get_blog_posts():
    posts = BlogPost.query.all()
    return render_template('blog.html', posts=posts)

@app.route('/blog/new', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def create_blog_post():
    if not current_user.is_admin:
        return jsonify({"status": "error", "message": "Access denied."}), 403

    data = request.get_json()
    title = data['title']
    content = data['content']
    
    new_post = BlogPost(title=title, content=content)
    db.session.add(new_post)
    db.session.commit()

    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Blog post created successfully."}), 201

blog.html
Basic layout to display blog posts.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Blog</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Blog Posts</h1>
    {% for post in posts %}
    <div>
        <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
        <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>

16. Notifications System

Adding a notification system to alert users about new updates, tickets, and blog entries.

notifications.py

from flask_mail import Mail, Message

mail = Mail(app)

def send_notification(user, subject, message):
    msg = Message(subject, sender='noreply@projectzero.com', recipients=[user.email])
    msg.body = message
    mail.send(msg)

@app.route('/notify_users', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def notify_users():
    data = request.get_json()
    subject = data['subject']
    message = data['message']
    
    users = User.query.all()
    for user in users:
        send_notification(user, subject, message)

    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Notifications sent."}), 200

17. Integrating AI for Continuous Improvement

Using AI to facilitate code reviews and generate reports.

ai_improvements.py

def ai_generate_report(code_snippet):
    prompt = f"Generate a detailed report on the following code snippet:\n{code_snippet}"
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message['content']

@app.route('/ai/report', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def ai_report():
    data = request.get_json()
    code_snippet = data['code_snippet']
    report = ai_generate_report(code_snippet)
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "report": report}), 200

18. Finalizing the Project Structure

To keep everything organized, here's an updated directory structure:

Let’s proceed with further refining the Project Zero framework by adding more advanced features, integrations, and enhancements based on the requirements we've discussed. This will include the integration of cloud services for file scanning, an improved ticket submission system, and user feedback mechanisms. Here are the next steps:
21. Cloud File Scanning and Integration

We’ll enable users to scan files from major cloud storage providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, iCloud) for vulnerabilities and malicious content.
21.1. Cloud Integration Functions

We’ll need a module for handling integrations with these cloud providers.

cloud_integration.py

import dropbox
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import onedrivesdk

# Function to authenticate and scan files in Dropbox
def scan_dropbox_files(user_access_token):
    dbx = dropbox.Dropbox(user_access_token)
    files = dbx.files_list_folder('').entries
    scanned_results = {}
    
    for file in files:
        # Scan each file (pseudo-scan function)
        result = pseudo_scan(file.path_lower)
        scanned_results[file.name] = result

    return scanned_results

# Function to authenticate and scan files in Google Drive
def scan_google_drive_files(credentials_file):
    credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(credentials_file)
    service = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=credentials)
    results = service.files().list().execute()
    items = results.get('files', [])
    scanned_results = {}
    
    for item in items:
        # Scan each file (pseudo-scan function)
        result = pseudo_scan(item['name'])
        scanned_results[item['name']] = result

    return scanned_results

# Function for OneDrive (using OneDrive SDK)
def scan_onedrive_files(access_token):
    client = onedrivesdk.get_default_client()
    client.auth_provider.set_access_token(access_token)
    items = client.item(drive='me', id='root').children.get()
    scanned_results = {}
    
    for item in items:
        # Scan each file (pseudo-scan function)
        result = pseudo_scan(item.name)
        scanned_results[item.name] = result

    return scanned_results

# Example pseudo-scan function
def pseudo_scan(file_name):
    # Implement your scanning logic here
    return {"status": "clean", "issues": []}  # Simulated result

22. Ticket Submission System Enhancement

We will enhance the ticket submission system to allow users to attach files and receive notifications when their ticket status changes.
22.1. Ticket Model Update

Update the ticket model to support file attachments.

models.py

from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class Ticket(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100))
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    status = db.Column(db.String(20))
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    file_attachment = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=True)  # Added for file uploads

22.2. Ticket Submission Route

Update the ticket submission route to handle file uploads.

ticket_management.py

from flask import request, jsonify
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

@app.route('/ticket/submit', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def submit_ticket():
    title = request.form['title']
    content = request.form['content']
    file = request.files.get('file')
    file_path = None
    
    if file:
        filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
        file_path = f'uploads/{filename}'
        file.save(file_path)

    new_ticket = Ticket(title=title, content=content, status='Open', file_attachment=file_path, user_id=current_user.id)
    db.session.add(new_ticket)
    db.session.commit()
    
    # Notify user about ticket creation
    send_notification(current_user, "New Ticket Created", f"Your ticket '{title}' has been created successfully.")
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Ticket submitted successfully."}), 201

23. User Feedback Mechanism

Implement a user feedback system where users can provide feedback on the service, which can help in improving the platform.

feedback.py

class Feedback(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'))
    content = db.Column(db.Text)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

@app.route('/feedback/submit', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def submit_feedback():
    content = request.json['content']
    new_feedback = Feedback(content=content, user_id=current_user.id)
    db.session.add(new_feedback)
    db.session.commit()
    
    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Feedback submitted successfully."}), 201

24. Real-Time Notifications and Status Updates

Users will receive real-time notifications about their ticket status and blog updates.

real_time_notifications.js

This script will use WebSockets to provide real-time notifications.

const socket = io.connect('http://localhost:5000');

socket.on('notify_user', function(data) {
    alert(`Notification: ${data.message}`);
});

25. Refining the Project Structure
